# Uber-Data-Analysis
R Project for Uber Data Analysis

This project is aimed at analyzing the Uber Dataset from April to September 2014 to understand which months have seen an increase in Uber bookings as well
as to understand on which dates do Uber rides tend to be booked more often. This can assist with adjusting pricing information accordingly.
